# Overview

This repo's goal is to give newcomers to dbt a starting point for running dbt cli in production. Some of the methods used here may be outdated/not follow best practice but will enable you to:
1. Run dbt at a regular cadence to get models updated
2. Have a robust CI/CD pipeline that minimises costs and ensures no breaking changes are merged to the production branch

GCP is the cloud provider of choice so anything cloud related will have to be tweaked to whatever cloud provider you are using. Improvements/suggestions are always welcome.
