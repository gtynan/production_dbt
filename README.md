# Overview

This repo's goal is to give newcomers to dbt a starting point for running dbt cli in production. Some of the methods used here may be outdated / not follow best practice but will enable you to:
1. Run dbt at a regular cadence to get models updated
2. Have a robust CI/CD pipeline that
    - Minimises costs
    - Ensures no breaking changes are merged to the production branch
